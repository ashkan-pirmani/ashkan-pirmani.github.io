## 🧐 **What’s It All About?**

Real-World Data (RWD) in healthcare holds immense potential 🌟 but is often tangled in challenges like:  
- 🧩 **Fragmented data** across various healthcare systems  
- 🔒 **Strict privacy and legal regulations**  
- ❌ Difficulty making data **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)**  

These issues are especially problematic for conditions like **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** where:  
- The disease’s low prevalence = dispersed RWD 📂  
- Variable data formats, quality standards, and guidelines = more barriers 🚧  

---

### 💡 **What Did My Research Do?**

My thesis advocates for a shift from **centralized** data analysis 🏢 to a **federated approach** 🌐.  
Federated analysis allows distributed datasets to be analyzed *without centralization*, preserving privacy and data integrity. 🔐✅

## 🏗️ **Three Pillars of My Work**

1️⃣ **Hybrid Data Management Pipeline**  
   - Supports integration of diverse data sources 📂📊  
   - Successfully implemented in the **Global Data Sharing Initiative** for **COVID-19 and MS** 🌍  
   - Resulted in the **largest cohort of MS and COVID-19 data ever collected**! 🏆  

2️⃣ **Federated Learning For Everyone (FL4E)** Framework  
   - Empowers stakeholders to better leverage RWD through adaptable federated analysis tools 🤝  
   - Introduced the concept of a **‘degree of federation’** to balance centralization vs. decentralization. ⚖️  

3️⃣ **Federated Analysis in MS Research**  
   - Used routine clinical data to predict disability progression in MS 🧠💡  
   - Proposed novel techniques to improve federation performance 🚀  
   - Proved federated analysis is a robust alternative to centralized methods. ✅

## 🌟 **Why It Matters**

This work paves the way for more **inclusive**, **privacy-aware**, and **pragmatic** technologies in healthcare. 💻💙  
By addressing critical gaps, federated data analysis can drive **innovation**, **collaboration**, and **better outcomes for patients worldwide**. 🌎👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️

🎉 **Thank You!**  
A heartfelt thank you to my supervisors, collaborators, and everyone who supported me on this journey. 🙏 Your guidance and encouragement made this milestone possible. 💖  

Here’s to the next chapter of advancing healthcare through technology! 🚀✨
