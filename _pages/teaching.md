🌟 I'm proud to be teaching member for the _“Data Science in Healthcare”_ course, part of the **Healthcare Engineering program** at Hasselt University 🏫 during the 2022-2023 and 2023–2024 academic year 📅. Guiding students as they dive into the fascinating intersection of healthcare and data science has been an incredible journey. Watching their curiosity grow as they tackle real-world challenges with data-driven solutions is truly inspiring! 💡✨

👨‍🏫 At KU Leuven, I’ve had the privilege of supervising **7 Master’s theses in Artificial Intelligence** 🧠. These projects explored cutting-edge topics in federated learning, model personalization, and predictive analytics. Here are some of the standout contributions:

- **Predicting Hospitalized Patients**: Comparing federated learning with pooled and local datasets.
- **Data Partitioning Scenarios**: Studying how data distribution affects training accuracy.
- **Federated Boosting in Semi-Supervised Learning**: Developing creative ways to improve boosting techniques in federated setups.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Exploring new ways to apply contrastive learning to improve AI models.
- **Personalized Models in Federated Learning**: Testing new architectures 🏗️ and exchanging parameters to enhance personalization.
- **Fine-Tuning Global Models**: Tweaking global federated learning models to boost performance.
- **Early Disease Detection**: Using shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for advanced diagnostics.
