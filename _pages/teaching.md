I am an active member of the teaching faculty for the “Data Science in Healthcare” course within the Healthcare Engineering program at Hasselt University for the academic years 2022-2023 and 2023–2024. In this capacity, I contribute to equipping students with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle real-world challenges in healthcare through data-driven approaches.

At KU Leuven, I have supervised seven Master’s theses in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on innovative topics such as federated learning, model personalization, and predictive analytics. These projects include:
	•	Comparing model performance for predicting hospitalized patients using federated learning versus pooled and local datasets.
	•	Analyzing the effects of data partitioning scenarios on training accuracy in federated learning.
	•	Implementing federated boosting techniques in semi-supervised learning.
	•	Exploring contrastive learning methodologies within Artificial Intelligence.
	•	Developing personalized models in federated learning by exchanging partial parameters and testing new architectures.
	•	Fine-tuning approaches for personalizing global models in federated learning to enhance performance.
	•	Early disease detection through shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) utilizing federated learning.
