🌟 I'm proud to be an active teaching member for the _“Data Science in Healthcare”_ course, part of the Healthcare Engineering program at Hasselt University 🏫, for the 2023–2024 academic year 📅. It’s exciting to guide students as they explore the intersection of healthcare and data science.

👨‍🏫 At KU Leuven, I’ve had the privilege of supervising **7 Master’s theses in Artificial Intelligence** 🧠. These projects tackled some fascinating topics in federated learning, model personalization, and predictive analytics, including:

- 🏥 **Predicting Hospitalized Patients**: Comparing federated learning with pooled and local datasets 📊.
- 📂 **Data Partitioning Scenarios**: Studying how data distribution affects training accuracy 📈.
- 🪄 **Federated Boosting in Semi-Supervised Learning**: Developing creative ways to improve boosting techniques in federated setups 🌐.
- 🧩 **Contrastive Learning**: Exploring new ways to apply contrastive learning to improve AI models 🔍.
- 🧑‍🔧 **Personalized Models in Federated Learning**: Testing new architectures 🏗️ and exchanging parameters to enhance personalization 🛠️.
- 🎯 **Fine-Tuning Global Models**: Tweaking global federated learning models to boost performance 🔧.
- 🧬 **Early Disease Detection**: Using shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for advanced diagnostics 🔬.

💡 For me, it’s all about advancing research in Artificial Intelligence 🤖 and healthcare data science 🩺 while mentoring the next generation of professionals and researchers 🌱. Watching students grow and push the boundaries of innovation is incredibly rewarding! 🔍
