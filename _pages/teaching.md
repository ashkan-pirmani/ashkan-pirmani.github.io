- Active teaching member for the "Data Science in Healthcare" course within the Healthcare Engineering program at Hasselt University for the academic years 2022-2023, 2023–2024.

- Supervised 7 Master’s theses in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven, focusing on federated learning, model personalization, and predictive analytics:
  - **Model Performance in Prediction of Hospitalized Patients**: A comparative study using federated learning versus pooled and local datasets.
  - **Effects of Different Data Partitioning Scenarios**: Investigated their impact on training accuracy in federated learning.
  - **Federated Boosting in Semi-Supervised Learning**: Developed innovative approaches for federated boosting techniques.
  - **Contrastive Learning in Artificial Intelligence**: Explored methodologies for leveraging contrastive learning techniques.
  - **Learning Personalized Models in Federated Learning**: Exchanged partial parameters and tested new architectures to enhance personalization.
  - **Fine-Tuning Approaches for Personalizing Global Models**: Improved federated learning model performance through tailored fine-tuning techniques.
  - **Early Disease Detection using Federated Learning**: Applied shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for advanced diagnostics.
