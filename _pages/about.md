# Hi there! 👋🏼

I am passionate about bridging the gap between **data science** and **healthcare innovation**, combining technical expertise with practical solutions to tackle real-world challenges. Most recently, I completed a `double PhD` at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where my focus was on making **real-world data (RWD)** both accessible and actionable. 💡

In healthcare, **data fragmentation** and **privacy concerns** are major obstacles to generating meaningful insights. My work explored how tools like `federated data analysis` can enable secure collaboration without compromising privacy. For example, I contributed to a **research-agnostic data analysis pipeline** that powered the **Global Data Sharing Initiative** for COVID-19 and **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**, assembling the `largest-ever dataset` for MS and COVID-19 🌍📊.  

Another key project was **FL-MS-RWD**, where I developed a `new Federated Learning (FL) schema and algorithm`. This work significantly improved predictive performance by enabling `global models` to adapt to local datasets. Using one of the `largest routine clinical datasets` available, we successfully predicted **disability progression in MS**, demonstrating how privacy-preserving models can outperform traditional methods. 🚀

## Why I Do What I Do 👨🏻‍💻

I am a firm believer in the power of **collaboration** to drive meaningful change. I thrive in **diverse, multidisciplinary teams**, blending **technical innovation** with **real-world applications**. Whether it is predicting MS outcomes, improving global data-sharing pipelines, or designing **federated ecosystems**, my focus is always on creating solutions that are **inclusive, accessible, and impactful**.

Here are some highlights of my work:
- Contributed to the **Global Data Sharing Initiative for COVID-19 and MS**, building the `largest dataset` of MS and COVID-19 cases to date, showcasing the impact of collaborative healthcare. 🌏📊
- Developed **FL4E (Federated Learning For Everyone)**, a `flexible framework` that bridges centralized and decentralized data analysis for real-world needs. 🔐🌐
- Introduced the concept of the **“degree of federation”** through the **FL4E platform**, allowing organizations to balance privacy and practicality for different use cases. 🎯
- Designed and demonstrated **personalized FL models** that adapt to diverse datasets, offering a powerful alternative to traditional centralized approaches. These models not only improved both accuracy and privacy but also highlighted the `potential of FL` to deliver superior, privacy-preserving results. 🧠✨
- Predicted **disability progression** in MS for over **26,000 patients**, leveraging one of the `largest routine clinical datasets` in a pioneering study.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between **data science** and **healthcare innovation**, and my journey so far has been shaped by the challenges and rewards of tackling real-world problems with practical solutions. Most recently, I completed a `double PhD` at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where my work focused on making **real-world data (RWD)** not just accessible but also **actionable**. 💡

In healthcare, **data fragmentation** and **privacy concerns** are massive hurdles to generating meaningful insights. My research explored how technologies like `federated data analysis` can enable collaboration without compromising data privacy. For instance,  I contributed to the development of a novel, `research-agnostic data analysis pipeline` that successfully powered the **Global Data Sharing Initiative** for COVID-19 and **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**, assembling the `largest-ever dataset` for MS and COVID-19 🌍📊. 
Or, I have designed a **new Federated Learning (FL) schema and algorithm** that significantly `enhanced predictive performance` by enabling `global models` to `adapt` to local datasets. This innovation was central to **FL-MS-RWD**, a **pioneering study** that used FL to predict disability progression in MS, leveraging one of the `largest routine clinical datasets` available.
