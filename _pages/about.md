Hello üëãüèº!

I recently completed a `double PhD` at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where my work centered on making data more `accessible` and `impactful` in healthcare.
 
My background in `Industrial Engineering` and `Business Administration` gives me a unique perspective on combining `technical expertise` with `practical solutions`‚Äîparticularly in `privacy-preserving data analysis`, such as `federated learning`.

Beyond research, I enjoy collaborating with `diverse teams` to bring fresh insights to complex challenges. My goal is to bridge `theory` and `real-world application`, focusing on `inclusive`, `cross-disciplinary approaches` that truly make a difference in `patient care`. Whether exploring new `Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)` strategies or developing `data-sharing pipelines`, I‚Äôm always driven by the belief that thoughtful, `collaborative innovation` can advance healthcare in tangible ways.
