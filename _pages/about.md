# Hi there! 👋🏼

I love turning **data** into stories that matter, especially in fields where `sensitive information` demands thoughtful handling and innovative solutions. I’m driven by the challenge of making data useful while navigating the **ethical, legal, and practical complexities** of working with it.

Most recently, I completed a `double PhD` in Belgium 🇧🇪 at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where I worked on making **real-world data (RWD)** more `accessible` and `actionable` to derive meaningful `insights` from it.

But let me tell you, working with data isn’t as `straightforward` as it sounds. It often feels like trying to solve a `jigsaw puzzle`, but this isn’t your typical puzzle. Imagine the pieces are `scattered` across different locations, some of them `locked away` in drawers labeled **“private”**, and others so `rare` they might as well be `one-of-a-kind`. Now, add a rule: you’re `not allowed` to move any pieces from their `original location`. That’s what working with data in fields like **rare diseases** or **low-prevalence conditions** feels like. `Every single piece matters`, _but putting them together is far from simple_.

> You’d think the solution would be `straightforward`: gather all the data into one place and get to work.

But in reality, **centralizing data** is often out of the question. **Privacy concerns**, **ethical dilemmas**, **data ownership rules**, and layers of **administrative hurdles** stand in the way. It’s like trying to build the `puzzle` while someone keeps reminding you, _“You can’t touch the pieces”._

So, how do we `solve` this? That’s where **Federated Learning (FL)** comes in. Think of FL as a way to build the puzzle `together`, but with a twist: `everyone` works on their pieces `separately`, sharing just `enough hints` to complete the bigger picture. With FL, **machine learning (ML)** models can be trained on `decentralized` data without ever `moving` the data itself. It’s a bit like a **long-distance relationship**, `collaborating` while keeping what’s personal `safe` and `secure`.

This approach doesn’t just safeguard privacy; `it opens doors`. Organizations can `work together` without worrying about _sensitive information leaving their walls_, unlocking `insights` that were once impossible to achieve.
My research focused on `designing` and `implementing` FL techniques to tackle exactly these kinds of `challenges`, bringing together **innovation** and **practicality** to make this futuristic idea a reality.

## Why I Do What I Do 👨🏻‍💻

The world is full of complex problems, and I believe the best solutions come from **collaboration**. But collaboration isn’t always easy, especially when sensitive data is involved. That’s why I love combining **technical innovation** with **practical problem-solving** to create tools that make working together possible—even when the odds are stacked against us. Whether it’s improving global data-sharing pipelines or designing tools for personalized predictions, I focus on creating solutions that are **inclusive, accessible, and meaningful**.

Here are some **highlights of my work** (check out more details on the [projects page](https://ashkan-pirmani.github.io/projects)):

- Built a **federated, research-agnostic data analysis pipeline** for the **Global Data Sharing Initiative** on COVID-19 and MS, contributing to one of the **most comprehensive datasets** for these conditions. 🌍📊
- Developed a **new federated learning approach** that enabled ML models to adapt to local datasets, significantly improving predictions like **disability progression** in MS. 🚀
- Introduced the concept of a **“degree of federation”**, offering organizations a flexible way to balance **privacy**, **practicality**, and **collaboration**. 🎯
- Created **FL4E (Federated Learning For Everyone)**, a framework bridging **centralized** and **decentralized data analysis** for real-world applications. 🔐🌐
- Pioneered a study that predicted **disability progression** in MS for over **26,000 patients**, using one of the **largest routine clinical datasets** available—all while keeping data secure. 🧠✨

<!-- # Hi there! 👋🏼

I am passionate about bridging the gap between **data science** and **healthcare innovation**, combining technical expertise with practical solutions to tackle real-world challenges. Most recently, I completed a `double PhD` at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where my focus was on making **real-world data (RWD)** both accessible and actionable. 💡

In healthcare, **data fragmentation** and **privacy concerns** are major obstacles to generating meaningful insights. My work explored how tools like `federated data analysis` can enable secure collaboration without compromising privacy. For example, I contributed to a **research-agnostic data analysis pipeline** that powered the **Global Data Sharing Initiative** for COVID-19 and **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**, assembling the `largest-ever dataset` for MS and COVID-19 🌍📊.

Another key project was **FL-MS-RWD**, where I developed a `new Federated Learning (FL) schema and algorithm`. This work significantly improved predictive performance by enabling `global models` to adapt to local datasets. Using one of the `largest routine clinical datasets` available, we successfully predicted **disability progression in MS**, demonstrating how privacy-preserving models can outperform traditional methods. 🚀

## Why I Do What I Do 👨🏻‍💻

I am a firm believer in the power of **collaboration** to drive meaningful change. I thrive in **diverse, multidisciplinary teams**, blending **technical innovation** with **real-world applications**. Whether it is predicting MS outcomes, improving global data-sharing pipelines, or designing **federated ecosystems**, my focus is always on creating solutions that are **inclusive, accessible, and impactful**.

Here are some highlights of my work:

- Contributed to the **Global Data Sharing Initiative for COVID-19 and MS**, building the `largest dataset` of MS and COVID-19 cases to date, showcasing the impact of collaborative healthcare. 🌏📊
- Developed **FL4E (Federated Learning For Everyone)**, a `flexible framework` that bridges centralized and decentralized data analysis for real-world needs. 🔐🌐
- Introduced the concept of the **“degree of federation”** through the **FL4E platform**, allowing organizations to balance privacy and practicality for different use cases. 🎯
- Designed and demonstrated **personalized FL models** that adapt to diverse datasets, offering a powerful alternative to traditional centralized approaches. These models not only improved both accuracy and privacy but also highlighted the `potential of FL` to deliver superior, privacy-preserving results. 🧠✨
- Predicted **disability progression** in MS for over **26,000 patients**, leveraging one of the `largest routine clinical datasets` in a pioneering study.
