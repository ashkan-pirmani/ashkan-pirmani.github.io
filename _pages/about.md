# Hi there! 👋🏼

I am passionate about bridging the gap between **data science** and **healthcare innovation**, and my journey so far has been shaped by the challenges and rewards of tackling real-world problems with practical solutions. Most recently, I completed a `double PhD` at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where my work focused on making **real-world data (RWD)** not just accessible but also **actionable**. 💡

In healthcare, **data fragmentation** and **privacy concerns** are massive hurdles to generating meaningful insights. My research explored how technologies like **federated data analysis** can enable collaboration without compromising data privacy. For instance, I developed part of a novel, research-agnostic data analysis pipeline that successfully powered the Global Data Sharing Initiative for COVID-19 and **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**, assembling the largest-ever dataset for MS and COVID-19. 🌍📊 or I developed a **new Federated Learning (FL) schema and algorithm** that significantly improved predictive performance by adapting global models to local datasets. This was a cornerstone of my work on **FL-MS-RWD**, a **pioneering study** that applied FL to predict disability progression in MS using one of the largest routine clinical datasets available. 🚀

## Beyond Healthcare 🌍
While healthcare is a major focus of my work, the strategies and technologies I’ve used/developed have far-reaching potential. Secure, privacy-aware collaboration across fragmented datasets can transform **finance**, **education**, and **public health**, where data integration is equally complex but essential. By applying innovative solutions to these fields, we can empower decision-making and create meaningful impact beyond borders. 🌟

## Why I Do What I Do 💙
Collaboration drives me. I thrive in **diverse, multidisciplinary teams**, blending **technical innovation** with **practical implementation** to solve complex problems. Whether it’s predicting MS outcomes, improving global data-sharing pipelines, or designing **federated ecosystems**, I’m deeply committed to making technologies more **inclusive, accessible, and impactful.**

Some of my proudest contributions include:
- Leading the **Global Data Sharing Initiative for COVID-19 and MS**, assembling the *largest dataset* of MS and COVID-19 cases, proving the power of collaborative healthcare. 🌏📊
- Developing **FL4E (Federated Learning For Everyone)**, a flexible framework that bridges centralized and decentralized data analysis, tailored to real-world needs. 🔐🌐
- Innovating **personalized FL models** that adapt to diverse datasets, outperforming conventional methods in both accuracy and privacy. 🧠✨
- Introducing the concept of the **“degree of federation”**, enabling organizations to balance privacy and practicality based on their goals. 🎯
- Used routine clinical data to predict **disability progression** in MS for over **26,000 patients**—one of the largest datasets of its kind.
- Demonstrated that **personalized federated models** not only preserve privacy but also outperform traditional centralized methods, marking a milestone in the use of RWD for clinical research. 🧠✨

## Let’s Connect! 🌟
I’m driven by the belief that thoughtful, **collaborative innovation** can transform industries. Whether you’re in healthcare, finance, or another field where **real-world data** is key, I’d love to exchange ideas and explore ways to collaborate. Let’s turn data into meaningful, actionable insights together! 😊







<!-- Hello 👋🏼!

I recently completed a `double PhD` at `KU Leuven` and `Hasselt University`, where my work centered on making data more `accessible` and `impactful` in healthcare, while also deriving `actionable insights` to drive better outcomes.

 
My background in `Industrial Engineering` and `Business Administration` gives me a unique perspective on combining `technical expertise` with `practical solutions`, particularly in `privacy-preserving data analysis`, such as `federated learning`.

Beyond research, I enjoy collaborating with `diverse teams` to bring fresh insights to complex challenges. My goal is to bridge `theory` and `real-world application`, focusing on `inclusive`, `cross-disciplinary approaches` that truly make a difference in `patient care`.

Whether exploring new `Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)` strategies or developing `data-sharing pipelines`, I am always driven by the belief that thoughtful, `collaborative innovation` can advance not only healthcare but also other critical domains, creating meaningful and lasting impact across industries. -->
